This folder contains code for calibrating both the grasper's position and the internal force sensor.
 * The `./Arduino Libraries` folder contains the non-standard Arduino Libraries needed for the calibration code to run. 
 * The `./Force Calibration` folder contains the data files from the force calibration process and the scripts needed to analyze that data and determine the calibration fit function.
 * The `./Position Calibration` folder contains the data files from the position calibration process and the scripts needed to analyze that data and determine the calibration fit function.
 * The file `Motor_Controller_Grasper_Project.json` is the metadata for all the data files generated in the calibration process
 * The file `ISMR21_0038_MS.pdf` is a PDF of the paper submitted to the ISMR 2021 conference. It is current as of June 1, 2021

Each folder in `./Calibration Setup` will have its own `README` file.
